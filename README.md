# LoanApproval
This is a Python program that uses machine learning to classify loan candidates as either approved or denied based on a given set of features. The program takes a CSV file as input and outputs a new CSV file with the classification result for each candidate.

# Features
The program uses feature engineering to create new features from the input data.

# Model
The program uses a machine learning model to classify the loan candidates. The model is trained on a labeled dataset with over 90% accuracy on the confusion matrix. The program uses a Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees to make the classification.

# Report
At the end of the program, a report will be printed to the screen that includes the total number of loan candidates, the number of approved and denied candidates, and the accuracy of the classification.
